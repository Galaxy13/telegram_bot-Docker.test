# Test of CI/CD systems using Telegram Bot app
Python Project with cloud Docker packaging

This bot receives messages from end-user, remembers them, and send you back in fixed time. 

Idea is *cloud based* application, which has to go through **pytest**, with using **Travis CI** for auto building and pulling app to **Docker** container.

Main logic of this bot is in progress, for now.
