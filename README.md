# Test of CI/CD systems using Telegram Bot app
Python Project with cloud Docker packaging

This bot receives text message from end-user, remembers them, and send you back a QR-code. 

Idea is *cloud based* application, which has to go through **pytest**, with using **Travis CI** for auto building and pulling app to **Docker** container.

To create the interaction between Telegram and local methods, was used a **pyTelegramBotAPI** 5.3
